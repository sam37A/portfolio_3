                    Hi, I am Suman Mainali, a WordPress developer, from Sacramento, California. 

                    I design and develop responsive websites. I use Wordpress <abbr title ="content management system">CMS</abbr> to develop a website which is a user -friendly and secured platform for any kind of website.

                    I held myself back for a long time thinking that the coding is not my  cup of tea. As Seth Godin said,  “If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try” and I did. The journey started a year ago joining the website for Beginners class, a workforce training course by Bitwise Industry. I studied basic html, css, bootstrap and Javascript and built the confidence to make a responsive website. Now it feels like I recognize my inner calling, and started enjoying coding where I can go beyond my imagination and satisfy the clients.
                    As they reiterate a lot here in Bitwise, ‘No one belongs more than you’, I literally felt special when Bitwise appointed me as the WordPress apprentice under Alpha Works training  for one whole year. I learned a lot about WordPress during the journey and got the opportunity to work on different projects which prepared myself to work for client projects. <br>
                    I look forward to working with future clients. Thank you.
