                    Oh! What a start of the New year. All the cell phones, social media, mail boxes are filled with good wishes and positive vibes. Almost all of us set our new year resolutions. Set new goals and ambitions for a brighter future. “I never procrastinate”,” I won’t waste a single fraction of seconds in unproductive chores”, “I will make my relationship exemplary”, “I will completely get rid of addictions ”, and so on and so forth. 
                    But  Woody Allen once said, “ if you want to make god laugh, tell him about your plan”. Well, mother nature has to offer something else, and she did. Eventually, reward of advancement,  honor of wisdom, and the bonus of supremacy is offered in her own way. There is no hearing over mother nature! Accept and move on. Or fall on the same pit over and over again.

                    Choices you take  are one and only golden wand to identify what you were, what you are, and what you will  be. We can’t override the past choice and expect a different reward. But, present and future choices can lead us to the new era in one condition, synchronizing with nature. Everything in nature is in a certain rhythm, all we need to do is flow accordingly. 

                    What we are just now is the result of what we did just a second ago. So, every ounce of second is counted. We can not shy away from our karma.

                        <summary>She Walks in Beauty</summary>
                        <pre>
                        She walks in beauty, like the night
                        Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
                        And all that's best of dark and bright
                        Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
                        Thus mellowed to that tender light
                        Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

                        One shade the more, one ray the less,
                        Had half impaired the nameless grace
                        Which waves in every raven tress,
                        Or softly lightens o'er her face;
                        Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
                        How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

                        And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
                        So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
                        The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
                        But tell of days in goodness spent,
                        A mind at peace with all below,
                        A heart whose love is innocent!
                         -Lord Byron</pre>

                    <h1>Thousand splendid suns</h1>
                    <p>A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years—from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding—that puts the violence, fear, hope, and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives—the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness—are inextricable from the history playing out around them.

                    Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heart-wrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love—a stunning accomplishment.</p>
